Week 1 - hours 24/30
  Monday Sept 28 - 6 hours
    - Read Rabiner Chapters 1 - 2 & took notes
    - Created rails app for presenting my project.
      Found gems for visualization of code and graphs (spectrograms, etc)

  Tuesday Sept 29 - 6 hours

    - Read and tookd notes on [Rabiner 1] Chapter 3 on Signal Processing

    - Read about Filter Banks, LPC and Vector Quantification
      This is all about transforming waveforms into data more suitable for matching

    - Didn't understand the math so i researched some more materials to help me out. [Damelin 2]

    - organized NOTES. added project Tasks section to notes this is where i will prove and display knowledge of what i've learned.

    - Started Reading [Damelin 2]

    - Listened to Kahn Academy lecture on Linear Algebra

  Wed Sept 30 - 6 hours

    - took notes

    - read from [Damelin 2]

    - aslo read from [Sterling 3]
        - basics of vectors

    - starteed reading [Vertelli 4]
      I'm thinking this will be a good medium between the two books above.

  Thur Oct 1 - 6 hours

    - watches some more Kahn academy videos on linear algebra about subspaces and basis's 

    - read more from [Vertelli 4]
      this was still a little too mathematical for me write now so i'm switching to another book that is written from more of and enginerring approach and specifically limits it's domain to discrete-signal processing

    - read from [Lyons 5 Understanding Digital Signal Processing]
      i like this books so far the domain is restricted to discrete-signals hopefully this will give me a better idea of how to start modeling my data structures to represent discrete-signals of speech

  Fri Oct 2 - 6 hours

    - started programming. 

    - created a DTS (discrete-time-signal) class to hold all information for a dts

    - created a simple DTS that is a simple sign wave and displayed it as a graph
