Pre-processing

	- convert a discrte signal into set of spectral vectors X

		- use a windowed function of 10ms which is common

		- convert X to coefficients

	- mark training data

Training

	Acoustic Model
		- train data

	Language Model
		- based on N grams
		- probability of W occuring


Matching


Modeling - training data

	A
